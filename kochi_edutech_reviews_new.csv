S M,"I enrolled in the Selenium with Java course at RogerSoft, and I must say the course fee is very reasonable. From the installation of the necessary software to assisting with mock test preparations, they have been extremely patient and supportive.
Remya Ma’am, who taught Selenium, was exceptional in her approach—explaining each concept in detail with great patience and care. Initially, I thought learning Selenium would be difficult due to my lack of coding experience, but her guidance made it much easier. The classes were not overcrowded, which meant we got plenty of personal attention, and the faculty were always available to clarify doubts.
They tailor their explanations to match our individual backgrounds and experience levels, which made learning much more effective. Even when there were unexpected holidays or leaves, the admin team made sure to reschedule the classes to ensure we didn’t miss out on anything.

They had also organized a placement campaign in which students were treated bad and had to wait for hours to get an interview which turned out to be a bad experience. Teaching staffs lack knowledge and students have to somehow fast track the course closure. The placement cell had given a fake interview from a company called Knorr-bremse and later i had found out that the so called company didn’t even have an opening and also from my knowledge i came to know that the placement cell were sharing job posting from NAUKRI. Kindly take this into consideration before joining and don’t believe all the ratings.

Harris Kunnel,"Honest Feedback on Techmindz Python Training Program

My cousins recently completed the Python training program at Techmindz. The training itself was very helpful, and they gained valuable skills along with four months of internship and project experience, which boosted their confidence. However, the institute promised 100% placement assistance, which has not been fulfilled.

Coming from a below-middle-class family, their parents invested ?40,000 per student, along with additional expenses amounting to nearly ?1 lakh, with the hope that this program would help them secure a stable job. Unfortunately, even after successfully completing the training, they are still struggling to find a job and are left chasing HR teams, referrals, and walk-in interviews—opportunities they could have pursued without Techmindz’s help.

The expectation from Techmindz was proper placement support, as assured during the enrollment process. However, the lack of real assistance has caused a lot of stress and disappointment for both the candidates and their families. The mental pressure of this situation is affecting them deeply.

I sincerely urge Techmindz to honor their commitment and genuinely support students in securing jobs. These candidates have worked hard, completed their training and internship successfully, and now deserve the opportunities they were promised. Please stand by your word and assist them in getting placed.",a month ago,Techmindz,11-03-2025,2,Negative,Python

Rashid M,"They only teach security systems and call it BMS. They don't even cover the latest technology in BMS. They teach few ELV devices basic panel settings, wiring and theory notes which easily available on internet. They claim to teach BMS, but they don’t even have a DDC panel or basic HVAC system settings and operations, which are major components of a BMS system. If  attend an interview in the right BMS field, most of the questions will focus on these areas. When I contacted their placement cell, they arranged  interviews for  CCTV technician role with a low salary, so I stopped reaching out to them. I also contacted a staff member for help learning about HVAC and DDC, but they didn’t assist me and treated me poorly. Before enrolling, I repeatedly asked your staff if this course would be suitable for becoming a BMS operator or technician. They assured me that securing a job in the proper BMS field with a salary above 15k would be possible, but this turned out to be a false promise. I lost around 30k and wasted my time.

Tbh, I'm really disappointed with their UI/UX design course.
The final project was the worst part. We worked hard on it, but they didn’t even open our Figma files or give any feedback. I was genuinely hoping for some constructive criticism after all that effort, but there was nothing.

The syllabus was also disappointing. It didn’t even cover the basics of UI/UX properly. As someone who already followed UI/UX designers online, I learned way more from social media than this course.

After months of finishing the course and job hunting, I’m still so unsatisfied with the support they provided.

To be clear, I'm not blaming the trainers here- they were fine. My issue is with the institution and the poor syllabus they're providing. It's supposed to help students gain better understanding of UI/UX and secure a job.

Parvathy Shyam,"Avoid Rogersoft at All Costs!
I had an extremely disappointing experience with Rogersoft Technologies Pvt Ltd. Their communication is abysmal—when faced with a crucial circumstance that forced me to discontinue my course, they refused to refund even a single penny. When I tried to follow up, they went as far as blocking my number! There are many more redflags. This is by far the worst learning center I've ever encountered. They are unprofessional and lack basic courtesy. If you're considering taking their DevOps class, or any course for that matter, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. DO NOT ATTEND ANY COURSES HERE!

Replying:
Thank you for your response, but simply stating that my concerns are ""absolutely wrong"" without addressing the specific issues won't help either of us resolve this matter.

I want to clarify that I attended classes only up to the GitHub section. You can verify this with the tutor, who I found to be a kind person, though unfortunately, he was also caught up in the issues I've experienced. I won't go into those details, but during the time I attended, there were multiple instances where users, including myself, had to send reminders just to receive the link to join the class. Additionally, recording sessions wasn't allowed, which further impacted my learning experience.

I had to stop the course due to personal commitments, and unfortunately, I was asked to make the mistake of paying the two time installments within two week's time. I understand your policy about refunds after attending several classes, but this course ultimately didn't help me, and I feel that my ?30,000 has gone to waste. Furthermore, communication has been difficult, especially after my number was blocked.

As a gesture of fairness, I would appreciate it if you could at least consider returning half of the money. This would go a long way in making this situation more bearable.",7 months ago,ROGERSOFT Technologies Pvt Ltd,11-09-2024,1,Negative,OTHER

naren vv,"hi. Narendran here. I graduated with a B. Tech in 2011 and worked in a variety of industries, including marketing, finance, etc .After 8 years, I entered the IT industry and made the decision to learn coding. I initially thought it was too difficult and frequently considered giving up. The issue I have  faced  is I am technically struck in coding and I have no strong base in fundamentals, as there is a long gap in my carrier. I asked my friends to help me. Everyone has insulted me a lot. To be frank, I lost my sleep and cried alone many times. At that time, I met one of my fried in a train and he suggested me  to join SCOPE INDIA. I made the decision to apply, and I enrolled in the full stack dot net developer course. The tutor or teacher is excellent. What I felt is that they were teaching like spoon feeding. Each and every aspect is clearly explained, line by line and word by word. They will only move on to the next topic ,only  once they have answered all of our doubts and queries. The trainers who have taught me were Koshy sir who has more than 20 years of expertise, who taught me computer fundamentals and SQL, and Antony sir, who taught me HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.  Initially I have no experience with the front end. Now I've learned how to create a website. Thanks to Antony sir's efforts. Varsha Mam taught C# using the MVC, Entity Framework, and Dot Not frameworks and Dot Not Core Web Api. I really enjoyed Varsha madam class. She is a genius and master  in Dot Net and many other programming languages. Now at the end my dream came true. I posses the confident to write the dot Net code in backend and I got the label as a Full Stack Developer.

Vivek Gopalakrishnan,"I think this institution is trying to cheat us. I completed my python django programming course from here on August mid. now 4 months have passed, and I didn't get any good job support from here.

They are offered maximum job support until we get a job. I only got an interview from there that was their NDZ interview, that was the only interview I got. after that they gave an interview to an institution as a tutor, didn't get an interview for the job as a python or django programmer. after they provided a supporter role in NDZ project (that's not based on my studies) I rejected these type of interviews( because that's not based on my studies), they told me that they can provide 4 interviews maximum.

I got cheated from here. So I strongly recommend don't join here to get a better job support and a job.They have good ratings in Google map. I didn't know how they got these 4 above rating. I joined here after i saw these ratings but I think it's fake, because nobody in my batch got a job after completion of course from here.If the rating 0 can provide for them i will strongly give the rating as 0/10.??
